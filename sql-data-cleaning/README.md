# SQL Data Cleaning: Customer Orders

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates basic SQL data cleaning and analysis tasks using two mock datasets: `customers` and `orders`. The goal is to simulate real-world challenges with missing values, invalid records, and the need for joins and aggregations.

## 📂 Files
- `customers.csv` – mock customer data
- `orders.csv` – mock order records
- `cleaning_queries.sql` – SQL scripts to clean and analyze the data

## 🧹 Tasks Performed
- Filtered out records with missing or invalid data
- Removed orders with `NULL` amounts and `invalid` status
- Joined customers and their valid completed orders
- Calculated total orders and amount spent per customer

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL (standard ANSI)
- Tested on SQLite (also compatible with MySQL/PostgreSQL)

## 🧠 Outcome
The project showcases my ability to:
- Clean and filter raw datasets
- Perform inner joins for relationship analysis
- Aggregate data for meaningful summaries

## 💡 Learning Goal
This project was created as a **self-practice SQL challenge** to build confidence in real-world data cleaning using SQL.
